3D Physics Engine ported to Haxe

[Original repo](https://code.google.com/p/jiglibflash/)

Spots a good set of features but needs documentation(classic), examples and general clean up. Haxe really could use at least one decent fully working and documented 3D physics solution - any help to make this happen is appreciated!
